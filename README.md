===============

Java Client For Connecting to Ape-Server.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kingster/Ape-Java-Client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kingster/Ape-Java-Client)

#### Note
1. This interfaces with @ptejada [ApePubSub](https://github.com/ptejada/ApePubSub). This will not work with APE_JSF. Switch over to ApePubSub as APS is modern, written in vanilla javascript and well documented. It fixes some existing issues with JSF while introducing new features (user/channel properties update, sessions management, cross-domain, easier setup, vanilla javascript etcâ€¦).For those not familiar with APS, JSF to APS migration demo is [availabe here](https://github.com/lcharette/JSF-vs.-APS---Move-demo)
2. This project uses [Java-WebSocket](https://github.com/Davidiusdadi/Java-WebSocket) v1.3.1-SNAPSHOT. Build on your local incase you are building this project as it is right now not available on maven repository.
